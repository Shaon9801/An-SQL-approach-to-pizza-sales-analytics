## Project Title:
## `Pizza Sales Analytics:` A SQL Approach to Revenue and Customer Behavior.
## Project Description
This project analyzes pizza sales data using **SQL** to generate insights into revenue, customer behaviour, and sales trends. It aims to help businesses understand sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.
## Objectives:
- `Revenue Analysis:`Track and analyze total revenue from orders by pizza category, type, and size.
- `Customer Behavior: `Identify purchasing patterns like average order value and multi-pizza orders.
- `Category Performance:` Identify the best-performing pizza categories and sizes.
- `Cumulative Trends:` Track revenue growth over time for better business forecasting.

## Key Features:
- `Revenue Calculation:` Summarizes total revenue across different dimensions like size and category.
- `Order Count by Time:` Analyzes orders based on time of day and day of the week.
- `Average Order Value (AOV):` Calculates the mean value per order.
 - `Sales by Pizza Type:` Tracks the performance of different pizza types by quantity and revenue.
 - `Peak Periods:` Identifies high-sales times like specific hours of the day or week.

   ## SQL Queries Overview:
   - `Revenue Metrics:` Tracks total and category-specific revenue.
   - `Customer Behavior:` Identifies multi-pizza orders to understand customer preferences.
   - `Sales by Time of Day:` Analyzes sales patterns during different times (morning, afternoon, evening).
   - `Top Pizza Types:` Identifies top-selling pizzas based on revenue.
   - `Trend Analysis:` Measures sales growth over time for informed decision-making.
  
   ## Performing Analysis with MySQL
  ### Show only the table details.
```sql
DESCRIBE ORDER_DETAILS;
DESCRIBE ORDERS;
DESCRIBE pizza_types;
DESCRIBE pizzas;

SELECT * FROM ORDERS;
SELECT * FROM ORDER_DETAILS;
SELECT * FROM PIZZAS;
SELECT * FROM PIZZA_TYPES;
```
### CS1: Total Revenue from all orders.
```sql
  WITH CTE AS
(SELECT 
    O.PIZZA_ID, O.QUANTITY, P.PRICE, QUANTITY * PRICE AS REVENUE
FROM
    ORDER_DETAILS AS O
       LEFT JOIN
   PIZZAS AS P ON P.PIZZA_ID = O.PIZZA_ID)
   

SELECT 
 ROUND(SUM(REVENUE),0) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM
CTE;
```
### CS2: ðŸ“Š Determine the top three pizza types by revenue within each category:
```sql
WITH RNK AS (
SELECT 
   PT.CATEGORY,
   PT.NAME,
   ROUND(SUM(P.PRICE * OD.QUANTITY), 2) AS REVENUE
FROM
   PIZZA_TYPES AS PT
       LEFT JOIN
   PIZZAS AS P ON PT.PIZZA_TYPE_ID = P.PIZZA_TYPE_ID
       LEFT JOIN
   order_details AS OD ON P.PIZZA_ID = OD.PIZZA_ID
GROUP BY 1, 2),
RNK_CTE AS( 
SELECT 
CATEGORY, NAME, REVENUE,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY CATEGORY ORDER BY REVENUE) AS RK
FROM RNK )
SELECT *FROM RNK_CTE
WHERE RK<=3;
```
## Output

### CS3: Mean order amount.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(od.quantity * p.price) / COUNT(DISTINCT od.order_id), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;
```

  SELECT 
    SIZE, SUM(QUANTITY) AS TOTAL_ORDERS, ROUND(SUM(REVENUE)) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM
    CTE
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
